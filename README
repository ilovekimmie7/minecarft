Things that will definitely be in the project:

Landscape generation:
-Perlin noise for the bottom layer (stone)
-same procedure for dirt (leave no spaces between dirt and stone)
-add water to all empty blocks below a certain sea level
-do a simulation for erosion across the entire map for caves and overhangs
-add lava to all empty blocks from bedrock level to 3 levels above the lowest empty block
-randomly plant tree seeds on dirt blocks, if there is sunlight on that block, grow the tree, otherwise delete the seed

Storage of data:
-3D array of Blocks on memory

Rendering:
-OpenGL

Lava/water Physics:
-spread horizontally for a maximum of 8 blocks from the source block
-spread down infinitely until the water reaches a solid block 



Things we consider adding if we finish early:
Character physics:
-legit physics in addition to noclip

Audio:
-OpenAL

Flight simulator:
-to easily and smoothly explore the landscape

Lighting:
-16 levels of lighting (brightest to no light), nearby light levels will influence the local light level
-light source blocks (torches) - light spreads out in a sphere, decays with distance
-light source blocks (top of the world) - light shoots down like a wide laser beam, doesn't decay

Enemies:
-an AI (possibly an implementation of A*) to chase the player if the player is within range
-attack by touching the player (this also means we will have to implement health, weapons, and armor)
