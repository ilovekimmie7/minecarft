Minecarft - Kevin Wang and Shan Shi

HOW TO RUN: Run `Minecarft' script in Minecarft/dist/.

Things that are in the project:
Landscape generation:
-Perlin noise for the bottom layer (stone)
-same procedure for dirt (leave no spaces between dirt and stone)
-add water to all empty blocks below a certain sea level
-do a simulation for erosion across the entire map for caves and overhangs
-add lava to all empty blocks from bedrock level to 3 levels above the lowest empty block
-randomly plant tree seeds on dirt blocks, if there is sunlight on that block, grow the tree, otherwise delete the seed

Storage of data:
-3D array of Blocks on memory

Front end:
-handled with libraries from LWJGL 2.8.2

Lighting:
-16 levels of lighting (brightest to no light), nearby light levels will influence the local light level
-light source blocks (torches) - light spreads out in a sphere, decays with distance
-light source blocks (top of the world) - light shoots down like a wide laser beam, doesn't decay

Things we might add:
Character physics:
-legit physics in addition to noclip

Audio:
-OpenAL

Enemies:
-an AI (possibly an implementation of A*) to chase the player if the player is within range
-attack by touching the player (this also means we will have to implement health, weapons, and armor)

The project is already done. We will try to use the lab days to make small improvements
